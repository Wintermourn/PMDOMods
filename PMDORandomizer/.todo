        It would be fun to have a sort of shuffling system (like effects that trigger while confused could be replaced with a different status),
        but it would probably be a lot of work to make sure the descriptions line up with what's actually happening. I suppose in the meanwhile,
        they could just be replaced with gibberish to show that they don't trigger like they usually would.
